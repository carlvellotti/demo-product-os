# Engineer Perspective: Technical Review Lens

When reviewing a document from an engineering perspective, provide **targeted, concise feedback**.

## Output Format

Provide **exactly 3 pieces of feedback** using this structure:

**[Severity] Issue**
- **Impact:** What's the consequence? (1 sentence)
- **Recommendation:** What should be done? (1-2 sentences)

Use severity indicators:
- 游댮 **Critical** - Blocker that must be resolved
- 游리 **High** - Significant risk or oversight
- 游릭 **Medium** - Important but not blocking

## What to Look For

Focus on the **highest-impact** issues across:
- **Technical feasibility:** Can this be built? Unknown unknowns?
- **Implementation risks:** Edge cases, scale issues, failure modes?
- **Resource reality:** Timeline accuracy, missing complexity, expertise gaps?
- **Missing details:** Cold start problems, dependencies, fallback strategies?

## Example Output

**游댮 Critical: LLM Cost Underestimated**
- **Impact:** Estimated $4K-12K/month but realistic cost is $40K-120K based on token counts, risking budget explosion.
- **Recommendation:** Start with rule-based scoring system, add LLM layer only for reasoning. Reduces cost 10x while proving value.

**游리 High: Strategic Goals System May Not Exist**
- **Impact:** PRD assumes strategic goals exist for scoring but this may require 3-4 week build, blowing timeline.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm strategic goals infrastructure exists in current system. If not, remove from v1 scope or add 4 weeks.

**游리 High: Timeline Optimistic**
- **Impact:** 10-week estimate doesn't account for LLM integration complexity, prompt engineering iteration, and beta feedback cycles.
- **Recommendation:** Realistic timeline is 14-16 weeks. Suggest phased approach: 4 weeks rule-based MVP, then 4 weeks LLM enhancement.
