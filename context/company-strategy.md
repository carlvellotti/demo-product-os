# TaskFlow Q1 2025 Strategy

## Strategic Context

We're at a pivotal moment. After 18 months of product-market fit validation, we're seeing strong organic growth but facing increased competitive pressure. Linear just raised $50M and is aggressively expanding into our market. Notion shipped a project management update that's getting traction.

**The window to establish market position is now.**

## Q1 Goals

### Revenue Target
- **Target:** $3.5M ARR (from $2.8M)
- **Driver:** Reduce churn from 6% to 4% monthly
- **Why it matters:** Retention improvement is 3x more valuable than new acquisition at our stage

### Product Priority
- **Ship one AI-powered feature** that demonstrably reduces PM overhead
- **Rationale:** Every competitor is adding AI. We need a differentiated AI capability, not generic autocomplete
- **Success criteria:** 40%+ adoption within 30 days of launch

### Market Position
- **Own the "fast PM" narrative** before Linear does
- **Content strategy:** 2 customer stories/month showing speed wins
- **Sales messaging:** "Ship in days, not sprints"

## Competitive Threats

**Linear** (biggest threat)
- Beautiful UX, engineering-focused
- Strong brand with developer audience
- Weakness: Complex for small teams, expensive

**Notion Projects**
- Existing user base gives them distribution
- All-in-one platform appeal
- Weakness: Not purpose-built for product teams

**Our Advantage**
- Purpose-built for PMs, not engineers
- Faster time-to-value than Linear
- Better integrations than Notion

## Key Constraints

**Team capacity:** 8 engineers, 2 designers
**Runway:** 18 months at current burn
**Tech debt:** Legacy codebase sections need refactor
**Market timing:** AI features expected by Q2 across the market

## Strategic Bets

1. **AI that saves time, not adds features** - Focus on reducing cognitive load
2. **Integration depth over breadth** - Go deep with Slack, GitHub, Figma
3. **Self-serve motion** - Minimize sales involvement to scale efficiently
