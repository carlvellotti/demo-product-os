# User Research: AI Needs for TaskFlow PMs

## Research Overview

**Conducted:** January 2025
**Method:** 20 in-depth interviews with active TaskFlow users (all PMs)
**Focus:** Pain points and AI opportunity areas

## Top Pain Points

### 1. Task Prioritization Overwhelm (mentioned by 18/20)

**The problem:**
PMs are drowning in tasks but struggling to figure out what to work on next. They have clear tasks but unclear priorities.

**Key quotes:**

> "I spend 30 minutes every morning just staring at my task list trying to figure out what's actually important. By the time I decide, half the morning is gone." - PM at Series B SaaS

> "My team asks 'what should I work on next?' and I don't have a good answer. I'm making it up based on vibes, not data." - PM at 50-person startup

> "I know all the frameworks - RICE, ICE, whatever. But applying them consistently? That's where I fail. It's too much overhead." - Senior PM at fintech

**What's happening:**
- 50-100 open tasks per PM is common
- Prioritization frameworks exist but require manual scoring
- Context switching makes it hard to maintain clear priority view
- Team members need direction but PMs don't have quick answers

### 2. Status Update Burden (mentioned by 15/20)

**The problem:**
Constantly updating stakeholders on "what's happening" is taking 5-10 hours per week.

**Key quotes:**

> "I write the same update in 3 places: Slack, email to exec team, and in our Monday standup. It's death by status update." - PM at healthcare startup

> "My CEO asks 'where are we on X?' and I have to dig through 5 threads to reconstruct what's happening." - Solo PM

### 3. Cross-Team Dependency Tracking (mentioned by 12/20)

**The problem:**
Work is blocked by other teams but tracking dependencies manually is overwhelming.

**Key quotes:**

> "I have no idea my feature is blocked by platform team until standup. Then we've lost a week." - PM at 100-person company

> "Dependency tracking is my biggest time sink. I'm basically a human Gantt chart." - Technical PM

### 4. Meeting Prep and Follow-up (mentioned by 11/20)

**The problem:**
Preparing for meetings and documenting decisions afterward is repetitive but necessary.

## AI Opportunity Analysis

### What PMs Want AI to Do

**1. Intelligent Task Recommendations (17/20 interested)**

"Tell me what to work on next based on:
- Strategic goals
- Blockers and dependencies
- Team velocity
- Deadlines and commitments"

**Desired behavior:**
- Proactive suggestions, not just search
- Context-aware (knows current sprint, team capacity)
- Explains reasoning ("This is urgent because...")

**2. Automated Status Synthesis (14/20 interested)**

"Summarize what's happening across my projects so I can answer 'where are we?' instantly."

**Desired behavior:**
- Pull from comments, commits, status changes
- Generate executive-friendly summaries
- Highlight risks automatically

**3. Dependency Detection (10/20 interested)**

"Alert me when my work is blocked or blocking others."

**Desired behavior:**
- Parse task relationships automatically
- Notify when dependencies are at risk
- Suggest workarounds

### What PMs Don't Want

❌ AI writing PRDs for them ("That's my job")
❌ AI making product decisions ("I need to think, not delegate")
❌ Chatbots for search ("Just let me search normally")
❌ Overly complex AI features ("Keep it simple")

## Key Insights

1. **PMs want AI for execution overhead, not strategic thinking**
   - They want to spend more time on strategy, less on coordination
   - AI should reduce cognitive load, not replace judgment

2. **Task prioritization is the #1 pain point**
   - It's daily, it's painful, and current tools don't solve it
   - PMs have frameworks but need help applying them consistently

3. **Context is everything**
   - AI needs to know team goals, deadlines, and dependencies
   - Generic suggestions won't work - must be deeply integrated

4. **Trust is earned through transparency**
   - PMs want to understand WHY AI suggests something
   - Black box recommendations will be ignored

## Recommendation

**Start with AI-powered task recommendations.** It addresses the most painful, most frequent problem. If we can save PMs 30 minutes every morning deciding what to work on, that's 20+ hours per month of strategic thinking time unlocked.
